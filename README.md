# Introduction

This languages Our language was developed in JavaScript using the [Chevrotain](https://github.com/SAP/chevrotain) library. As with any interpreted language, it contains 3 major components: a Lexer, a Parser, and an Interpreter (termed a visitor in the Chevrotain library), which are developed in order within executor.js

# User guide

To run our interpreter, make sure you have node installed on your system. Then cd into our project and run “npm install”. Then run “node executor.js”.
